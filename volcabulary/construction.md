[1] We used boxes as a makeshift while the kitchen chairs were being painted.

[2] What we can do about squeaky floor?﻿

[3] wait wait wait is that a stepless escalator?﻿

[4] For the grouting I used one of those icing piping bags they use for cakes. 
    Less grout needed, less of a mess, same results as far as I know.

[5] angle grinder / toilet flange.
    Shannon from http://www.house-improvements.com shows you how to cut a circle into a tile. 
    In this demonstration, he uses an angle grinder with a diamond segmented cutting blade to cut a hole for a toilet flange.

[6] Rotary Hammer Drill / Masonry Drill / GWC / nominal / nick / preservation
    Rotary Hammer Drill Masonry Drill 5 bits "USED Drill" in GWC
    This is a good condition Hilti Rotary Hammer Drill in good working condition with some scraps and discoloration.
    I have a case from a TE-15 that fits it perfectly available if buyer wishes to purchase it separately for a nominal price.
    The cord has two locations where it has been nicked. One is taped up the other shows the inner wiring, but not cut on the inner wires.
    I cleaned and oiled the drill and bits for better examination and preservation.

[7] handyman / diss
    Never in the twenty years of being a handyman have I ever seen a flange installed on top of a finished floor.
    The key word in that sentence is "handyman". 
    I'm not dissing handymen, it's just that your primary encounter with toilets is long after the building was built. 
    It was just about 20 years ago that inspectors started wanting to see the flange installed on top out. 
    Before that, the flange wasn't installed until finish. 
    But then the inspector didn't see the flange installed, and they didn't want to make an additional inspection. 
    They'd have to be there in the middle of a plumber installing fixtures. 
    The inspectors can't give a exact time when they'll be there and the plumber doesn't want to stand around waiting on the inspector. 
    It's a problem. Take it from a master plumber. 
    The flange, by code, must be installed on the finished floor with brass screws or anchors.
