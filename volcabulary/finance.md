[1] collateral / shadow bank
    The boss was in deep debt, and when he told me he was going to register my car, 
    and get car insurance for me, he ended up using it as collateral for his shadow bank debts.

[2] contrarian investing / prevailing sentiment / clamor
    Contrarian investing is an investment strategy that is characterized by purchasing and selling in contrast to the prevailing sentiment of the time.
    Contrarians zig when everyone else zags. They tend to buy when everyone else is selling, sell when everyone else is buying.
    The result is that the contrarian often buys a cheap security that everyone else is calling a dog and sells a security that everyone else is clamoring to get into.

[3] tax liability / incur
    A tax liability is the amount of taxation that a business or an individual incurs based on current tax laws.
    A taxable event triggers a tax liability calculation, which is the tax base of the event multiplied by a tax rate.
    Tax liabilities are incurred due to earning income, a gain on the sale of an asset or other taxable events.

[4] arbitrage / exploit
    Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from a difference in the price.
    It is a trade that profits by exploiting the price differences of identical or similar financial instruments on different markets or in different forms.
    Arbitrage exists as a result of market inefficiencies.

[5] provision / liability
    An amount set aside from a company’s profits for an expected liability or for the decreasing value of an asset, though the specific amount might be unknown.
    The resulting impact of a provision is a reduction in a company's equity.

[6] LIBOR / maturities
    LIBOR or ICE LIBOR (previously BBA LIBOR) is a benchmark rate that some of the world’s leading banks charge each other for short-term loans.
    It stands for IntercontinentalExchange London Interbank Offered Rate and serves as the first step to calculating interest rates on various loans throughout the world.
    LIBOR is administered by the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), and is based on five currencies: 
    U.S. dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), pound sterling (GBP), Japanese yen (JPY) and Swiss franc (CHF), 
    and serves seven different maturities: overnight, one week, and 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months. 
    There are a total of 35 different LIBOR rates each business day. The most commonly quoted rate is the three-month U.S. dollar rate.
