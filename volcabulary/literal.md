[15] Some people still have the mentality of the dark ages. It's 2016 people. An honorable man would have paid his bill and an honorable man would not have killed someone over a bill. Both were wrong, but the man who decided to murder another human is far out of line and should be imprisoned for life.﻿

[22] Surprise the employee didn't kick u out for filming. If I filmed at my local Starbucks here in Murica. An employee would tell me to get out if I started filming or take selfies.

[23] The school I am thinking about contracting with says I may not teach side-jobs without their permission. Is this common for ESL teacher contracts?﻿

[24] Absurd comment. Instead of condemning violence you're saying "be respectful". So if someone isn't respectful, you think hacking them to death is acceptable? Which is worse?﻿

[25] A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture when suddenly a
brand-new BMW advanced out of the dust cloud towards him. The driver, a
young man in a Broni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie,
leaned out the window and asked the shepherd... "If I tell you exactly how
many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?" The shepherd
looked at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looked at his peacefully
grazing flock and calmly answered "sure".
The yuppie parked his car, whipped out his IBM ThinkPad and connected it
to a cell phone, then he surfed to a NASA page on the internet where he
called up a GPS satellite navigation system, scanned the area, and then
opened up a database and an Excel spreadsheet with complex formulas. He
sent an email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, received a
response. Finally, he prints out a 130-page report on his miniaturized
printer then turns to the shepherd and says, "You have exactly 1586 sheep.
"That is correct; take one of the sheep." said the shepherd. He watches
the young man select one of the animals and bundle it into his car.
Then the shepherd says: "If I can tell you exactly what your business is,
will you give me back my animal?", "OK, why not." answered the young man.
"Clearly, you are a consultant." said the shepherd. "That's correct." says
the yuppie, "but how did you guess that?" "No guessing required." answers
the shepherd. "You turned up here although nobody called you. You want to
get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked, and
you don't know crap about my business...... Now give me back my dog.”
