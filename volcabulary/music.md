[1] Manuscript paper (sometimes staff paper in U.S. English, or just music paper) is paper preprinted with staffs ready for musical notation.

[2] In Western musical notation, the staff or stave (plural for either: staves) is a set of five horizontal lines and four spaces that each represent a different musical pitchâ€”or, in the case of a percussion staff, different percussion instruments.
