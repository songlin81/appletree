[6] I drink only because it cures my hangovers.﻿

[7] Bottom line: come here knowing you'll splurge, then sit back to enjoy a fine dining experience.

[8] sashimi

[9] It was a great atmosphere dining right next to where the food was being prepared and cooked and we enjoyed sharing a communal table giving us the chance to meet others visiting Beijing.

[10] porridge

[11] They are foie gras of the sea, indeed they are.﻿

[12] P.S. I heard you both ordered a "tall" which is a small , so she didnt get it wrong, venti = large﻿

[13] This is a communal kitchen, this means that there is one single table where about 10-12 people share a 10 course dinner.

[14] A zesty palate full of flavour of limes and citrus with a tingle on the tongue.

[16] watery / canned
    Brewing your own beer at home is easy, inexpensive, fun, and will most likely produce a brew far superior to that watery canned stuff.

[17] Bacchus
    You'll also become like Bacchus to your beer buddies!

[18] mesh / submerge
    The best way to brew your own beer is to steep your grains in a mesh bag and submerge them in a large stock pot of hot water for 30 minutes.
    
[19] malt extract
    Then, add malt extract to the pot and bring the water to a boil.

[20] wort
    Chill the pot of wort in ice water and then pour it into a fermenter.
    
[21] ethyl
    The yeast ferments the sugars, releasing CO2 and ethyl alcohol. 

[22] scrubber / pathogens / grooves / sanitize
    Do not use a scrubber that will scratch the surface of whatever you're scrubbing—pathogens love to grow in the grooves left behind, 
    and they're almost impossible to sanitize.
    
[23] bleach / iodine
    Rinse well, then soak briefly in a bleach or iodine solution.

[24] distilled
    Rinse everything well with distilled water

[25] tannins / astringent
    Do not squeeze the bag, because you may extract tannins that will give your beer an astringent flavor.

[26] expedite / aerate / funky
    You can gently stir the wort to help expedite the cooling, 
    but try not to splash or aerate the wort while it's still hot (it can make for some funky flavors).

[27] sediment
    Leave about a quarter inch in the bottle—the sediment tastes a little yeasty, and will give you serious beer farts.

[28] sensibly
    Typically the people operating specialty brewing shops will advise you sensibly!

[29] polyphenol / antioxidant
    Choose hops that are high in polyphenol antioxidants.

[30] barista
    The word barista is an Italian word, and in Italy, a barista is a male or female "bartender", 
    who typically works behind a counter, serving hot drinks (such as espresso), 
    cold alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and snacks.

[31] repellent
    You could plant one, but that doesn't mean you'll get much harvest from it.
    It can be killed by city pollution, stolen by neighbors, destroyed by neighborhood pets, or eaten by wildlife.
    My parents planted a garden, put up a fence, used deer repellent, and still had 95% of it eaten by deer.
    They even ate the hot peppers.

[32] branching gills
    Prawns are larger in size, and have larger legs with claws on three pairs. 
    They have branching gills. Shrimp are smaller, have shorter legs and have claws only on two pairs.
